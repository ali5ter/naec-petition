# Wordpress petition page template

Re-factoring of a standalone PHP application as a Wordpress custom page
template for the NAEC website (http://NAeastCambridge.org).

The original application, supplied by Michael Hawley, provided a simple
petition (operating rather like a website guestbook feature) for the abatement
of the Sullivan Courthouse redevelopment proposal at 40 Thorndike.

The NAEC site uses a Wordpress theme called Solo
(http://themetrust.com/themes/solo). This template is integrated with Solo by
constructing a child theme called, `solo-child`.
