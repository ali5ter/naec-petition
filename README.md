# Wordpress Petition template page

Migration of a standalone PHP application to a custom Wordpress template page
for the NAEC website.

The original application provided a simple petition (operating rather like an
old website guestbook feature) for the original Sullivan Courthouse
redevelopment proposal.

The NAEC site uses a Wordpress theme called Solo
(http://themetrust.com/themes/solo). So it made sense to integrate the
functionality into a custom template page delivered in a child theme called

    solo-child
