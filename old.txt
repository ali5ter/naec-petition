But  since  Mr.  Behrends  has  posted  his  view  of  why  this  building  should  be  preserved,  a  brief  rebuttal  is  below.  --  MH]</p><p>      Folks,  "rethinking"  the  building's  character  to  conform  to  current  tastes  is  a  short-sighted  idea</p><p>Steve,</p><p>So  given  that,  I  presume  you  are  opposed  to  the  Leggat  McCall  renovation,  which  involves  totally  gutting  the  building  and  then  gift  wrapping  it  in  glass,  with  a  brick  podium  below?    The  only  thing  it  would  have  in  common  with  the  original  is  the  steel  frame.    Moreover,  the  original  is  regarded  as  a  deeply  flawed  design.    It  started  as  18  floors  with  a  huge  base  plaza  (http://40thorndike.org/misc/sullivan-orig.jpg),  but  the  plaza  and  base  were  eliminated  when  the  state  ran  out  of  funds.    That  is  considered  by  most  to  be  a  lucky  break  as  it  would  have  wiped  out  all  of  the  Bulfinch  plaza  and  the  historic  19th  century  buildings  all  the  way  to  Cambridge  Street  and  across.    It  was  only  the  mind  boggling  corruption  and  graft  that  drove  the  cost  up  6x  from  the  starting  point  and  burdened  taxpayers  for  30  years  to  pay  off  the  interest  that  prevented  the  certain  distraction  of  the  old  buildings.    In  fact,  when  the  Sullivan  Building  went  up,  the  block  they  bulldozed  was  filled  with  charming  19th  century  buildings,  including  a  keeper’s  house,  and  a  women’s  jail  made  of  Quincy  granite.    Not  quite  as  spectacular  as  the  Charles  St  jail  (now  the  Liberty  Hotel),  but  nonetheless  surprisingly  beautiful.    During  excavation  for  Sullivan,  flaws  were  found  in  the  foundation,  which  caused  no  end  of  problems,  and  another  4  floors  were  added.    I  did  an  extensive  search  in  the  Boston  Globe  and  could  not  find  a  single  positive  news  article  about  this  building.    Words  like  “Blunder”,  “Fiasco”,  “Travesty”  are  used  to  describe  it.    The  building  was  the  subject  of  grand  jury  investigations,  civil  suits,  senate  hearings,  arbitration  involving  thousands  of  witnesses.    The  jail  cells  were  too  small  —  39  square  feet,  which  is  16  feet  less  than  minimum  standards.    The  cells  on  the  top  floors  were  beyond  the  reach  of  fire  ladders.    It  was  questioned  whether  the  jail  would  ever  be  used  at  all.    It  was,  but  they  packed  in  400  in  a  space  designed  for  163.    The  prisoners  rioted,  tossed  flaming  mattresses  out  the  window,  sued  the  State,  and  won.    In  2007  as  it  was  being  abandoned  after  barely  25  years  of  use,  the  State  commissioned  an  extensive  study  to  look  into  possible  renovation  of  the  building.    The  budgeted  cost?    $394m.    Among  other  things,  it  is  an  environmental  hazard,  filled  with  90,000  lbs  of  asbestos.    It  is  dilapidated.</p><p>I  can  think  of  some  brutalist  buildings  worth  preserving.    The  Sullivan  building,  however,  is  not  one  of  them.    It  was  truly  a  failure  from  start  to  finish.    The  Cambridge  Historical  Society  regards  it  as  a  “monument  to  corruption  and  bad  management."</p><p>Mike</div><p></div>
